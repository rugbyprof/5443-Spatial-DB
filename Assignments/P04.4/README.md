`𝑔`: the gravitational acceleration—usually taken to be 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup> near the Earth's surface

`θ`: the angle at which the projectile is launched

`𝑣`: the speed at which the projectile is launched

`𝑦0`: the initial height of the projectile

`𝑑`: the total horizontal distance traveled by the projectile

The height `𝑦` of the projectile at distance `𝑥` is given by eq

However I'm writing a 3D game engine and would like to find out how to make that equation work in a three dimensional space 𝑥,𝑦,𝑧.
