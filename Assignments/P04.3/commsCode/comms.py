""" Background message passing app. Routes messages between players using a 
    keyword type schema.
    
## HOWTO:

### Sender:
    To get started sending messages, you need a copy of your credentials, then an instance of the `CommSender` class. 
    
    ```python 
    # Credentials
    creds = {
        "exchange": "battleship",
        "port": "5672",
        "host": "battleshipgame.fun",
        "user": "us_navy",
        "password": "rockpaperscissorsrabbitdonkey",
        "hash": "61ec12b68d0ded5f6a84b7d1f6d4d8e70695c2ba5dd7176fc3e4c3d53db9ecf2"
    }
    # Instance of class with creds being passed in as kwargs
    commsSender = CommsSender(**creds)
    ```
    Messages contain two parts: first the topic or keyword and then the message. The topic is to direct the message to the proper queue so the recipient will receive it. 
    
    1. The topic can be anything, but for our game we will use some conventions so everyone will send and receive messages correctly. The first rule is to send a message to another team you use the following format: `teamname.#` where you replace the teamname with an actual teamname, and the hashtag with a specific command like `fire` (which is for now the only command we have between teams). The second rule is if you want to send a message to everyone you use `broadcast.#`. Anything with the keyword `broadcast` will go to everyone. 
    
    2. The message can be anything, unless you're firing upon a team, then it needs to be proper json with proper keys and values. 
    
    ```python
    # Example broadcast message
    cmd = "broadcast.#","Hey everybody!!"
    commsSender.sendCommand(cmd[0],cmd[1])
    
    
    # Example team fire message
    ## d = decimal 
    ## f = float
    ## lon/lat is where the projectile should strike
    ## angle is the angle in which it is coming
    ## kg is the weight of the projectile
    
    cmd = "axis.fire","{'lon':dd.fffff,'lat':dd.fffff,'angle':dd.ff,'kg':dd.ff}"
    commsSender.sendCommand(cmd[0],cmd[1])
    
    # you could put the 'commands' directly in the function call:
    commsSender.sendCommand("axis.fire","{'lon':dd.fffff,'lat':dd.fffff,'angle':dd.ff,'kg':dd.ff}")
    ```
    Once a sender sends a message, it can close its connection, unlike a listener who must always be listening. 
    
    ```python
    commsSender.closeConnection()
    ```

        A binding key is a way of "subscribing" to a specific messages. Without
        getting to the difference between "routing" and "topics" I will say topics
        should work better for battleship. Valid topics are things like:

           python.javascript.cpp

        This topic would receive any messages from queues containing the routing
        keys: `python` or `javascript` or `cpp`. You can register as many keys as you like.
        But you can also use wild cards:

            * (star) can substitute for exactly one word.
            # (hash) can substitute for zero or more words.

        So if you want to get all messages with your team involved:
            teamname.#
        Or if you want all messages that fire at you:
            teamname.fire.#
        Or if you want to send a message to everyone:
            broadcast.#

        Follow the link above to get a better idea, but at minimum you should
        add binding keys for anything with your teamname (or maybe id) in it.
